## Description 

https://vimeo.com/263343966

Creating WordPress pages should be fast & easy. [Brizy](https://brizy.io/) is the most user-friendly visual page builder in town! No designer or developer skills required. The only tools you'll need to master are clicks and drags.

## Highlights

### Smart & clutter free
Most page builders crowd all the options for a specific element in remote sidebars, making it hard to focus on the task at hand. We show only what's needed, front & centre, close to the element you're editing.

### Intuitive Drag & Drop
Moving content elements, columns or rows is a breeze with our intuitive Drag & Drop feature. Just grab and drag them to the desired position and everything will instantly fall into place.

### Design Elements
Text, buttons, images, icons, video, maps and many more are ready to help you create your page design in a snap.

### Over 150 pre-made blocks
Blocks are pre-made designs that you can add to your page, ready to be customised. This will enable you to create the main structure of your page in a matter of minutes, while also ensuring that it looks awesome.

### Over 4000 icons included
Available in both Outline and Glyph versions, even the most demanding icon needs are covered. Quickly find the icons you're after by filtering through categories or searching by keywords.

### Undo / Redo
Don't worry if you make a mistake or delete something that you shouldn't have. With Undo you can get everything back.

### Global styling
Ever wanted to change all the similar colors in your web page with a single click? With Brizy, you can! Not only that, but you can change all texts that share the same properties in one go, as well.

### Mobile Friendly
Switch instantly to Mobile View mode, where you can make changes that will only apply to this type of devices. This gives you the power to differentiate your page design and optimise for smaller screens.

### Cloud auto-save
The progress you're making while building your page is always backed up in the cloud, so you'll never lose your work.
